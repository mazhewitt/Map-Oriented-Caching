While everyone else covered the horrors of the Somme and Ypres, I dared to be different and focussed on munitions manufacture and the consequential nationalisation of alcohol brewing and drinking in the area. Hmmmm.\\n\\nMy interest was re-kindled when we came to live and work in the area many years ago and I made a friend whose grandmother had been a \\\"munitionette\\\" at the Gretna site during the First World War.   On meeting her, I felt that my disappointment 20 years earlier on receiving a \\\"missed the point\\\"comment on my thoroughly researched project (complete with a State Brewery beer bottle and a traced map of the vast Solway site; you couldn't beat greaseproof paper and pencil for a replica diagram) had been entirely justified.   I heard first hand at just how dangerous the work had been and what the conditions were like for the unsophisticated girls who worked there. She remembered being thrilled with the visit of the King and Queen (George V and Mary; our current Queen's Grandparents) and was still proud of the contribution she'd made to the war effort. She's long gone now but I remember her with great affection......unlike Mr D, my J4 teacher!!\\n\\nAnyway, childhood disappointments aside, we parked up close to the cache and were surprised at just how busy the road was.  The cars fairly fly along so watch any little people or pets if you park where we did. The cache was soon found (loved the container) so we had plenty of time for a walk in the woods with Molly.  \\n\\nA super cache providing a lovely wander along memory lane and in the woods, thankyou!!<\\/groundspeak:text>\\n        <\\/groundspeak:log>\\n        <groundspeak:log id=\\\"222266272\\\">\\n          <groundspeak:date>2012-03-27T19:00:00Z<\\/groundspeak:date>\\n          <groundspeak:type>Found it<\\/groundspeak:type>\\n          <groundspeak:finder id=\\\"2903925\\\">jigglybones<\\/groundspeak:finder>\\n          <groundspeak:text encoded=\\\"False\\\">What a difference a week or so makes.

It was a gloriously sunny, and warm, day as we pulled up off the main road, a la jigglybones,  and walked the 70 yards or so through the wood to the cache area. The gps was being a bit sluggish under the tree cover, but nevertheless we had a reasonable fix at the centre of a 10 yard circle. But, although we understood the hint, we just could not find the little blighter. After about half an hour of ever desperate and fanciful searching, we gave up and headed off to Talking Tarn for our walk. It was only on our return that we decided to give it another go and this time went straight to it. Sometimes there is no rationalising these things. Great description on the cache page of the munitions factory on this site. Who would have believed the scale of it. Also an excellent little cute cache container.<\\/groundspeak:text>\\n        <\\/groundspeak:log>\\n        <groundspeak:log id=\\\"219104440\\\">\\n          <groundspeak:date>2012-03-17T19:00:00Z<\\/groundspeak:date>\\n          <groundspeak:type>Found it<\\/groundspeak:type>\\n          <groundspeak:finder id=\\\"2471849\\\">BigLad &amp; Co.<\\/groundspeak:finder>\\n          <groundspeak:text encoded=\\\"False\\\">1922.\\nWoooweee FTF!!!\\nParked as suggested and enjoyed the short walk through the wood on this beautiful spring like morning.  Just a solo effort by BigLad today leaving the rest of the team to pour over their homework and chores.  Started to panic a touch at GZ as there were many hiding places even though I \\\"got\\\" the clue.  Mrs BL and the kids had visited the Devil's Porridge museum before, but I don't imagine that any knowledge gained would have helped with the find.  Found after a short search - loved the container, very apt indeed [:D]!\\nThat's four FTF out of four on the CO's caches, however it looks as if the streak stops here as (speaking to the COs at this afternoon's event) the next one may be hidden in foreign lands [}:)].

Surely, I could grab it quickly despite having to get home to Annan and get the 18.14 train to Dumfries for whisky tasting. \\n\\nI reversed into a handy spot just 80m from the cache and squelched along the path in a torrential downpour. Being Friday, the work clothes didn't really matter. Approaching the cache, I saw two deer who scarpered  quickly leaving me in isolation to find the cache. The rain was so hard, the touch screen phone seemed to be changing screens every time I held it out which hampered the find. After about 5 minutes I realised that the 'FTF' prize wasn't for me, so headed off to my whisky tasting.\\n\\nI met the CO the next day who gave me a big hint as to where the cache is.

Hmmmm.\\n\\nMy interest was re-kindled when we came to live and work in the area many years ago and I made a friend whose grandmother had been a \\\"munitionette\\\" at the Gretna site during the First World War.

I heard first hand at just how dangerous the work had been and what the conditions were like for the unsophisticated girls who worked there.

Found the cache easily and what a cute container it is too! Loved reading all the information on the 'Devil's Porridge'. Thanks for the cache which was my 1100th.<\\/groundspeak:text>\\n        <\\/groundspeak:log>\\n        <groundspeak:log id=\\\"220644682\\\">\\n          <groundspeak:date>2012-03-24T19:00:00Z<\\/groundspeak:date>\\n          <groundspeak:type>Found it<\\/groundspeak:type>\\n          <groundspeak:finder id=\\\"2107474\\\">Free Timers<\\/groundspeak:finder>\\n          <groundspeak:text encoded=\\\"False\\\">Gosh, what a meal we made of finding this cache. It was a gloriously sunny, and warm, day as we pulled up off the main road, a la jigglybones,  and walked the 70 yards or so through the wood to the cache area. The gps was being a bit sluggish under the tree cover, but nevertheless we had a reasonable fix at the centre of a 10 yard circle. But, although we understood the hint, we just could not find the little blighter. After about half an hour of ever desperate and fanciful searching, we gave up and headed off to Talking Tarn for our walk. It was only on our return that we decided to give it another go and this time went straight to it. Sometimes there is no rationalising these things. Great description on the cache page of the munitions factory on this site. Who would have believed the scale of it. Also an excellent little cute cache container.<\\/groundspeak:text>\\n        <\\/groundspeak:log>\\n        <groundspeak:log id=\\\"219104440\\\">\\n          <groundspeak:date>2012-03-17T19:00:00Z<\\/groundspeak:date>\\n          <groundspeak:type>Found it<\\/groundspeak:type>\\n          <groundspeak:finder id=\\\"2471849\\\">BigLad &amp; Co.<\\/groundspeak:finder>\\n          <groundspeak:text encoded=\\\"False\\\">1922.\\nWoooweee FTF!!!\\nParked as suggested and enjoyed the short walk through the wood on this beautiful spring like morning.  Just a solo effort by BigLad today leaving the rest of the team to pour over their homework and chores.  Started to panic a touch at GZ as there were many hiding places even though I \\\"got\\\" the clue.  Mrs BL and the kids had visited the Devil's Porridge museum before, but I don't imagine that any knowledge gained would have helped with the find.  Found after a short search - loved the container, very apt indeed [:D]!\\nThat's four FTF out of four on the CO's caches, however it looks as if the streak stops here as (speaking to the COs at this afternoon's event) the next one may be hidden in foreign lands [}:)].

Surely, I could grab it quickly despite having to get home to Annan and get the 18.14 train to Dumfries for whisky tasting. \\n\\nI reversed into a handy spot just 80m from the cache and squelched along the path in a torrential downpour. Being Friday, the work clothes didn't really matter. Approaching the cache, I saw two deer who scarpered  quickly leaving me in isolation to find the cache. The rain was so hard, the touch screen phone seemed to be changing screens every time I held it out which hampered the find. After about 5 minutes I realised that the 'FTF' prize wasn't for me, so headed off to my whisky tasting.\\n\\nI met the CO the next day who gave me a big hint as to where the cache is.

Irgendwann habe ich dann aber den Koordinaten doch vertraut und einfach am einzig möglichen Versteckort nachgeschaut. Und da war sie dann auch. Beim Taucher habe ich aufgrund der - im Nachhinein völlig falschen - Geländewertung des Caches nicht an der richtigen Stelle nachgeschaut. Irgendwann blieb dann keine andere Option übrig. Also flugs runtergeklettert und prompt das gesuchte Rätsel gefunden. Und auch beim Final habe ich erst mal am falschen Ort gesucht.

Dieser jemand stellte sich dann als Lizard.king vor und bestätigte mir, am richtigen Ort gesucht zu haben. Da dann auch Herr Kaulfrosch und JanD die Infos ebenfalls nicht finden konnten, bekamen wir Hilfe von Lizard.King. Während Frau Kaulfrosch mit den Zahlen jonglierte, genossen Herr Kaulfrosch und ich abwechselnd das kühle Nass. Schnell war klar, wo sich die Endbox befand. Da kalt duschen aber Hunger machte, widmeten wir uns zuerst dem Foodcachen [:D]. Der erste Bergungsversuch wurde dann vom mir gemacht.

Nachdem ich mir ein paar Gedanken gemacht und ein paar offensichtliche Wi.........e notiert hatte, legte ich es wieder zur Seite, nachdem ich die 5 Terrain-Sterne bemerkt hatte. \\n\\nHeute morgen hat uns unverhofft ein Anruf der Berüchtigten aus dem Bett geholt (war es eigentlich schon hell?), dass sie sich heute eine kalte Dusche gönnen werden - die dazu notwendige Basisausrüstung (Schwerkraft-Entkoppler, einen Satz Nuklearbrennstäbe, Seile, Rollen, Restlichtverstärker) sei bereits gepackt. Okay, wenn das so ist, sollten wir uns wohl langsam anziehen...\\n\\nNachdem wir die ganze Ausrüstung bis zum Ziel geschleppt hatten, machten wir uns fröhlich an die Ermittlung der ersten Zahlen. Es hat ein bisschen gedauert, bis wir realisierten, dass auch die einfacheren Zahlen nicht [i]ganz[/i] so einfach sind. Die [i]Junior-Berüchtigte[/i] entpuppte sich als Draufgängerin und ging als erste auf Zahlensuche während der [i]Chef-Berüchtigte[/i] souverän sicherte. Der Bach führte heute ziemlich viel Wasser, sodass es ziemlich schwierig war, bei dem tosenden Lärm überhaupt vernünftig zu kommunizieren. Trotzdem hatten wir einige Minuten später bereits alle Hinweise lokalisiert; einer konnte jedoch nicht entziffert werden. Drei Zahlen sind besser als keine - aber definitiv zu wenig um den Cache zu finden. [}:)]\\n\\nUnd so blieb nichts anderes übrig, als nochmals einen Durchgang zu absolvieren - aber dieses Mal war [i]Mr. RCH65[/I] an der Reihe. Nach einem schnellen Abstieg zur fehlenden Zahl hatte ich zuerst auch nur einen \\\"leeren\\\" Hinweis erblickt aber nach genauerer Untersuchung (gar nicht so einfach bei diesem vielen Wasser) war klar, dass der Hinweis von einer dicken Kalkschicht überzogen ist, welche zuerst entfernt werden muss. Nachdem das endlich geschafft war, konnten wir uns schliesslich an die Berechnung der Endkoordinaten machen.\\n\\nAb jetzt darf ich natürlich nicht mehr allzu viel erzählen - ausser dass wir einige Minuten später doch tatsächlich die sehr gut versteckte Cachebox erspähten und uns (nachdem auch die letzte Hürde genommen war) frisch geduscht ins Logbuch eintragen durften.

Wow, was wir da sahen übertraf unsere Erwartungen. Nach den letzten Regenfällen kam da eine ganze Menge an kaltem Duschwasser. Ja, der Roiber hat sich inzwischen eingedeckt für diese Wassertemperatur und eine Abkühlung tut immer gut um überhitzte Gemüter zu kühlen.

[:P]\\nLangsam näherten wir uns den Nullkoords. Toll. Was für eine schöne Gegend! [8D] Und das noch bei bestem Duschwetter. Was der Hai dann vor Ort sah, machte ihn ganz \\\"chribbelig\\\". Sowas gefällt mir! Schnell noch in die richtige Haut schlüpfen - auch d'ronja hatte endlich die Kleidung aufgepimpt [^] - und looooooooooooooos. Einfach mega! Die Duschmenge war nach den Regenfällen übrigens nicht ganz ohne - der Duschablauf kam kaum nach. [:P] Kein Sissi-Rinnsal, nein, sondern die volle Packung. Saucool! [:D]\\nNachdem die Körperreinigung komplett war, durften wir uns dann bald in der tollen Box eintragen. Auch hier hat alles gepasst. Brillenträger, die die Brille auch beim Duschen auf haben, sind ev. im Vorteil. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt hatte ich gedacht, dass es mir meine Linsen eh schon lange ausgespült hat.

Friedlich schnurrte unsere Katze vor sich hin, als wir ihr eine Portion Streicheleinheiten gaben. Und so konnten wir in aller Ruhe die Haare ihres Felles zählen. Dass sie ab und zu doch irgendwo ein Haar liegen lässt, spielte für einmal keine Rolle, da nur die ersten drei Stellen der Anzahl Haare gefragt war. Und so waren schlussendlich alle zufrieden: unsere Katze kriegte ihre Streicheleinheiten, und wir konnten das Rätsel lösen. Was nun folgte, war dann ganz und gar nicht für die Katz, denn diese sträubt sich vor jeglichen Tropfen Nass und macht sich schnell aus dem Staub, wenn auch nur ein Tropfen Wasser ihr Fell benetzt. Bei uns war es gerade umgekehrt, denn wir freuten uns richtiggehend bei diesen frühsommerlichen Temperaturen eine kalte Dusche nehmen zu gehen. Vor Ort konnten wir ausgiebig im kühlen Nass den Tag ausklingen lassen. Die erfrischende Dusche war einfach herrlich und belebte die Sinne. Quasi als \\\"Bettmümpfeli\\\" konnten wir dann zu guter Letzt noch einen Cache aus einem überaus tollen Versteck ziehen.\\n\\nDanke, Boletus Edulis &amp; Lizard King, für diesen absolut toll gemachten Mystery!

Die Geocacherkarte wurde sehr genau unter die Lupe genommen. Schlussendlich habe ich mich für einen Besuch im Küsnachter-Tobel entschieden. Da haben die Kids genügend Gelegenheit um sich aus zu toben und für Mama gab es ab und zu ein Döschen [:P]. Was will Frau noch mehr [;)]!\\n\\nNach dem zMorge starteten wir unsere Tour und marschierten zu Fuss an den Bahnhof. Dort erwartete uns die S9, welche uns zum Bhf. Stadelhofen beförderte. Von dort aus ging die Reise mit der roten Frieda (Forchbahn) weiter. Einen kleinen Halt durften wir bei Rehalp einlegen, denn dies war die letzte Frieda-Dose die uns für den Bonus noch fehlte. Danach ging die Reise bis nach Zumikon weiter. Von dort aus starteten wir unseren Fussmarsch in Richtung Küsnachter-Tobel. Von \\\"Gwundrig und Clever\\\" über \\\"Die Drachenhöhle (Küsnacht), wo wir nach Besuch der Höhlen auch unsere Mittagspause verbrachten, bis hinauf zu \\\"Bazzi\\'s Schübelweiher\\\" und wieder runter ins Tobel und auf der anderen Seite rauf zur \\\"Ruine Wulp\\\" war alles dabei. Eine herrliche Wanderung in schönster Umgebung. Einfach Idylle und Natur pur.\\nNachdem dann (fast) alle geplanten Dosen besucht waren, durften sich die Kids im Dorfbach noch so richtig austoben, auskühlen und verweilen. Irgendwann war dann genug Füsse gebadet, die Hosen auch genügend nass und unser Nachhause rufte ebenfalls. Der Weg bis zum Bahnhof war wiederum gespickt mit viel Natur. Vorbei am Alexander-Stein und dem Steingarten, bis zum \\\"Dorfmuseum\\\" und schlussendlich den Weg zum Bahnhof. Dort gönnten wir uns ein Glace und warteten erschöpft und zufrieden auf unseren Zug.\\n\\nEin schöner und erlebnisreicher Tag geht zu Ende. Es war einfach traumhaft. Die Kids haben die Strapazen gut gemeistert und kamen, wie auch Mama, voll auf ihre Rechnung.\\n\\nWir möchten uns bei allen Owners der von uns besuchten Schätzen bedanken. Dank diesen Dosen wurde unsere Wanderung zu einem unvergesslichen und lässigen Abenteuer. Merci.\\n\\nZum Cache \\\"Bazzi\\'s Schübelweiher\\\":\\nNachdem wir eine kleine Mittagsverpflegungspause bei der Drachenhöhle eingelegt hatten, zogen wir gut gestärkt weiter. Ob wir genügend Kraft für ein dieses Abenteuer hatten, wussten wir nicht genau. Doch wir waren eben sehr gwundrig. Schnell war auch ein geeigneter Weg zum besagten Baum gefunden. Um den Nullpunkt herum machten wir uns ein wenig Schlau. Als dann das Gesuchte von Junior geortet wurde, gab es für ihn kein zurück mehr. Ob das gut kommt [?] [B)]! Während sich Junior an die Arbeit machte, sassen Zwergli und Mama in der Nähe etwas tiefer unten. Zuschauen konnte Mama nicht, nur mitfiebern und anfeuern, dass konnten wir zwei Frauen sehr gut. Irgendwann kam von einigen Stockwerken höher das Eche \\\"bi dobe am logge\\\". Juhuii, ein Weg geschafft. Schon nach wenigen Augenblicken spürte Mama einen Hauch warme Luft und die Botschaft \\\"Mami ich bi wieder da\\\" drang ins innere von meinem rechten Ohren und belebte sogleich meinen Körper und Geist. Bravo [:o)]. Junior hat dieses Abenteuer super gemeistert. Ich bin sehr stolz auf ihn [;)]! Ihm hat dieser Ausflug sehr viel Spass gemacht.

Seine Rückreise in die Schweiz, wo er bekanntlich als Europakorrespondent tätig ist, führte ihn deshalb von Japan aus über Singapur weiter nach Indonesien. Dann ging es in die Südsee nach Tonga und es folgte ein langer Flug über den Pazifik in die USA. Als nächstes stand Kanada auf dem Programm. Danach machte Sodido in Tunesien erstmals Bekanntschaft mit dem afrikanischen Kontinent und flog einige Tage später weiter in die Türkei. Unbedingt wollte er auch noch Georgien kennenlernen, um schliesslich über Polen reisend glücklich wieder in der Schweiz zu landen.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\nAls er später seine zahlreichen Reisebilder anschaut, da fällt ihm etwas auf.

Ein Logbuch von diesem Format sieht man wirklich nicht alle Tage und es wird uns wohl auch noch lange in Erinnerung bleiben.

Das Logbuch war dann das Riesen-Pünktchen auf dem i- wunderbar...\\nVielen Dank für den von A-Z wunderbaren ?-Cache à la Cassiopeias</groundspeak:text>\\n        </groundspeak:log>\\n        <groundspeak:log id=\\\"252792449\\\">\\n          <groundspeak:date>2012-07-28T19:00:00Z</groundspeak:date>\\n          <groundspeak:type>Found it</groundspeak:type>\\n          <groundspeak:finder id=\\\"1160969\\\">reika</groundspeak:finder>\\n          <groundspeak:text encoded=\\\"False\\\">#3113 / geloggt: 13:20\\nFür eine Weltreise braucht es immer eine gewisse Vorbereitung, da die Reise kurzfristig angesagt war hat diese Vorbereitung Pasatho perfekt erledigt.\\nVielen Dank dafür.\\nAm Nullpunkt musste ich natürlich auch noch etwas dazu beitragen und so habe ich die \\\"Riesen Box\\\" geborgen.\\nVielen Dank für diese Herausforderung und den \\\"Mega Cache\\\"\\nReika</groundspeak:text>\\n        </groundspeak:log>\\n        <groundspeak:log id=\\\"252385596\\\">\\n          <groundspeak:date>2012-07-27T19:00:00Z</groundspeak:date>\\n          <groundspeak:type>Found it</groundspeak:type>\\n          <groundspeak:finder id=\\\"2342529\\\">urusuchris</groundspeak:finder>\\n          <groundspeak:text encoded=\\\"False\\\">Zuerst die Cracks und dann die Gruftis.
