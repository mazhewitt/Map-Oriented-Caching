While everyone else covered the horrors of the Somme and Ypres, I dared to be different and focussed on munitions manufacture and the consequential nationalisation of alcohol brewing and drinking in the area. Hmmmm.\n\nMy interest was re-kindled when we came to live and work in the area many years ago and I made a friend whose grandmother had been a \"munitionette\" at the Gretna site during the First World War.   On meeting her, I felt that my disappointment 20 years earlier on receiving a \"missed the point\"comment on my thoroughly researched project (complete with a State Brewery beer bottle and a traced map of the vast Solway site; you couldn't beat greaseproof paper and pencil for a replica diagram) had been entirely justified.   I heard first hand at just how dangerous the work had been and what the conditions were like for the unsophisticated girls who worked there. She remembered being thrilled with the visit of the King and Queen (George V and Mary; our current Queen's Grandparents) and was still proud of the contribution she'd made to the war effort. She's long gone now but I remember her with great affection......unlike Mr D, my J4 teacher!!\n\nAnyway, childhood disappointments aside, we parked up close to the cache and were surprised at just how busy the road was.  The cars fairly fly along so watch any little people or pets if you park where we did. The cache was soon found (loved the container) so we had plenty of time for a walk in the woods with Molly.  \n\nA super cache providing a lovely wander along memory lane and in the woods, thankyou!!<\/groundspeak:text>\n        <\/groundspeak:log>\n        <groundspeak:log id=\"222266272\">\n          <groundspeak:date>2012-03-27T19:00:00Z<\/groundspeak:date>\n          <groundspeak:type>Found it<\/groundspeak:type>\n          <groundspeak:finder id=\"2903925\">jigglybones<\/groundspeak:finder>\n          <groundspeak:text encoded=\"False\">What a difference a week or so makes. I returned to this cache on a pleasant spring day and didn't need to squelch through the mud this time. I spotted my tracks where I'd slid down the bank near the bridge though.

It was a gloriously sunny, and warm, day as we pulled up off the main road, a la jigglybones,  and walked the 70 yards or so through the wood to the cache area. The gps was being a bit sluggish under the tree cover, but nevertheless we had a reasonable fix at the centre of a 10 yard circle. But, although we understood the hint, we just could not find the little blighter. After about half an hour of ever desperate and fanciful searching, we gave up and headed off to Talking Tarn for our walk. It was only on our return that we decided to give it another go and this time went straight to it. Sometimes there is no rationalising these things. Great description on the cache page of the munitions factory on this site. Who would have believed the scale of it. Also an excellent little cute cache container.<\/groundspeak:text>\n        <\/groundspeak:log>\n        <groundspeak:log id=\"219104440\">\n          <groundspeak:date>2012-03-17T19:00:00Z<\/groundspeak:date>\n          <groundspeak:type>Found it<\/groundspeak:type>\n          <groundspeak:finder id=\"2471849\">BigLad &amp; Co.<\/groundspeak:finder>\n          <groundspeak:text encoded=\"False\">1922.\nWoooweee FTF!!!\nParked as suggested and enjoyed the short walk through the wood on this beautiful spring like morning.  Just a solo effort by BigLad today leaving the rest of the team to pour over their homework and chores.  Started to panic a touch at GZ as there were many hiding places even though I \"got\" the clue.  Mrs BL and the kids had visited the Devil's Porridge museum before, but I don't imagine that any knowledge gained would have helped with the find.  Found after a short search - loved the container, very apt indeed [:D]!\nThat's four FTF out of four on the CO's caches, however it looks as if the streak stops here as (speaking to the COs at this afternoon's event) the next one may be hidden in foreign lands [}:)].

Surely, I could grab it quickly despite having to get home to Annan and get the 18.14 train to Dumfries for whisky tasting. \n\nI reversed into a handy spot just 80m from the cache and squelched along the path in a torrential downpour. Being Friday, the work clothes didn't really matter. Approaching the cache, I saw two deer who scarpered  quickly leaving me in isolation to find the cache. The rain was so hard, the touch screen phone seemed to be changing screens every time I held it out which hampered the find. After about 5 minutes I realised that the 'FTF' prize wasn't for me, so headed off to my whisky tasting.\n\nI met the CO the next day who gave me a big hint as to where the cache is.
